                    <h2>Technology: My Damn Good Reason to NOT Have Children</h2>
                    <h4>A Poorly Written Rant About Loving and Hating What we Like to Call Progress</h4>
                    

                    <p>We live in an age of instant conection, instant communication, and more often than not, instant responses. We were not born into this world, we, as a human collective, created it, grew with it, enhanced it, produced new innovative ways to communicate and accomplish tasks, and now we are trapped by it.

                    <p>Of course, technological advancement is, in general, a good thing. Don't get me wrong, I'll never have to worry about being lost while driving again, but will my (never-gonnna-happen) kids even need to learn the cardinal directions? I can shoot a text telling my friends and/or family that I'm running late for an engagement, but will the future youth of the world really understand the value of punctuality like my generation, and those before me, where we set a time and kept our engagements, because there was no easy way to update or cancel with the other person. </p>

                    <p>Right now, I can go home from work, but I can't stop working, because my email is synced to my phone, and my personal work computer is obviously a laptop, and everyone has internet, so there's no excuse there, and the deadline just got pushed up, and... Will that change before my non-kids become adults? Would it be fair to subject them to a parent that is only half-present because work never ends now, and there's no time to cook a real meal or help with homework? They don't deserve that world, and neither do we.</p>

                    <p>When I was a child, I constantly witnessed people interacting with each other face to face. I saw strangers spark up conversations and make connections that lasted far longer than the breif, almost nonexisitant conversations strangers have in America today. It was almost common sense to assume that the majority of people surrounding me were good, diverse human beings and each knew something I didn't. We didn't put our heads down in public. We didn't pretend not to hear strangers say things when they walked by on the streets. We embraced human contact.</p>

                    <p>Children and young adults today have a very different experience. They did not grow up with a phone plugged into a wall that shared a connection with the slowest dial-up internet imaginable. They carry everythging they need - and more - in their pockets. They have digital identities that mirror each facet of their actual lives just enough that no group would think poorly of them. They would rather text, or pretend to, than say hello to someone they do not know on a buss. The majority of them know more about computer interfaces than they do the rules of a soccer match or baseball game. </p>

                    <p>From the time they start school, they have their own digital identities. Actually, many of them begin the second they are born. Embarassing baby pictures used to be a sacred prize of a long-term, healthy relationship, but now the individual has no choice. From day one many parents publish incredible amounts of information about their children to live forever on the glorious and terrible internet. The children are subject to what their parents think should be shared with their friends, and often their friends' friends, and even people they have never met. </p>

                    <p>You cannot take away what is published about you, and sadly, digital identities help deturmine everything from what college an individual will be accepted into to what company will hire him/her and why. My (never-gonnna-happen) future kids don't deserve that, and they don't need a TV as a nanny, and they don't need to have to try to understand why they are so different from the children around them.</p>
